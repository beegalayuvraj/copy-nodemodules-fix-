# copy-nodemodules-fix-
This file is used to copy the Node js project from one location to other location . 


Problem: 

Whenver we copy the files from one drive to other drive in windows. we get too long path error. Please specify the
src and target directory to copy the files recursively by ignoring node_modules

If you remove node_modules from ignore files. it will copy node_modules too.
